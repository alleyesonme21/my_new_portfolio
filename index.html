      <h1>Professional</h1>
      <p> My decision to

        collaborative and intensive environment and have practical work force
        exposure through the hand's on internship program. My short term goal
        is work for a tech company focused on <span>music, arts and education.</span> My
        long-term goal is to build a programming school in Haiti and provide

  <h1>Hobbies</h1>
  <p>
    In my free time, I perform & practice rhythm guitar. I spent over 15 years as a professional reggae, R&B and
    rara guitarist throughout the Caribbean and Latin America. I have been a member of four internationally
    touring bands that has lead me to <span> Mexico, Bahamas, Cuba, Dominican Republic and Chile.</span> In 2017, my band
    4Harmony was selected to represent Haiti in an international folklore & televised music competition called
    Vi√±a del Mar Festival in Chile where we placed 3rd in a 4-week original songwriting competition. As a new
    musical challenge, I have recently taken up keyboard. When not playing music, I spent my free time traveling
    with my wife, cooking at home and lifting weights at the gym. .</p>
