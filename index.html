      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Originally from Haiti, I moved to the United States in 2018. I am a
        former international development worker <span>(Doctors Without Borders)</span> and
        professional touring reggae guitarist. I am passionate about
        development in my native Haiti, music and the joy that it can bring,
        and computer programming. I am proudly tri-lingual and speak Haitian
        <strong>Creole, French and English</strong> fluently.</p>

      <h2>Professional</h2>
      <p> My decision to
        learn programming at <em>Epicodus</em> is informed by my desire to learn in a
        collaborative and intensive environment and have practical work force
        exposure through the hand's on internship program. My short term goal
        is work for a tech company focused on music, arts and education. My
        long-term goal is to build a programming school in Haiti and provide
        job skills training in my country.</p>

      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <p>
        In my free time, I perform & practice rhythm guitar. I spent over 15 years as a professional reggae, R&B and
        rara guitarist throughout the Caribbean and Latin America. I have been a member of four internationally
        touring bands that has lead me to Mexico, Bahamas, Cuba, Dominican Republic and Chile. In 2017, my band
        4Harmony was selected to represent Haiti in an international folklore & televised music competition called
        Vi√±a del Mar Festival in Chile where we placed 3rd in a 4-week original songwriting competition. As a new
        musical challenge, I have recently taken up keyboard. When not playing music, I spent my free time traveling
        with my wife, cooking at home and lifting weights at the gym. .</p>
