        development in my native Haiti, music and the joy that it can bring,

      <h2>Professional</h2>
      <p> My decision to
        learn programming at <em>Epicodus</em> is informed by my desire to learn in a
        collaborative and intensive environment and have practical work force
        exposure through the hand's on internship program. My short term goal
        is work for a tech company focused on music, arts and education. My
        long-term goal is to build a programming school in Haiti and provide
        job skills training in my country.</p>

  <h2>Hobbies</h2>
  <p>
    In my free time, I perform & practice rhythm guitar. I spent over 15 years as a professional reggae, R&B and
    rara guitarist throughout the Caribbean and Latin America. I have been a member of four internationally
    touring bands that has lead me to Mexico, Bahamas, Cuba, Dominican Republic and Chile. In 2017, my band
    4Harmony was selected to represent Haiti in an international folklore & televised music competition called
    Vi√±a del Mar Festival in Chile where we placed 3rd in a 4-week original songwriting competition. As a new
    musical challenge, I have recently taken up keyboard. When not playing music, I spent my free time traveling
    with my wife, cooking at home and lifting weights at the gym. .</p>
